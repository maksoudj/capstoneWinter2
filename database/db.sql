When students document these step-by-step instructions they arecreating algorithms.As students learn to construct simple algorithms that reflect a daily activity, they realize that the sequences have a beginning,middle, and end. Just as people use algorithms to complete daily routines, they can program computers to use algorithms tocomplete different tasks. Algorithms are commonly implemented using a precise language that computers can interpret."),

People work together to plan, create and test theseprograms. This process of planning, creating, and testing a program or an algorithm is called programming and is used to create awide variety of products such as video games, interactive art projects, and digital stories.The sequencing of tasks and the testing of programs can be done with or without the use of a computer. When it is done without acomputer it is considered an unplugged activity. Unplugged activities allow students to understand the sequencing and testingprocess in a concrete way. Unplugged activities can be found at sites such as CS Unplugged.Programs can also be developed and tested using computer applications; these are referred to as plugged activities.

The use of manners when collaborating orinteracting with others through computing devices or networks is more complex since many times the communication is donewithout seeing the person on the other side of the communication. For example, communications should be clear and concise andshould never represent the words and actions of others as your own. Care should be taken when sharing information so that theintent of the message is not misunderstood by the person on the other end of the communication.In addition, due to the anonymous nature of online communication, intimidating and inappropriate behavior in the form ofcyberbullying may occur.

Students can explore different types of security measures andunderstand how each one protects us in different ways from different types of electronic breaches and attacks. Physical securitymeasures include locking rooms with devices, badges, fingerprints, security cameras, paper shredding, etc. Digital security measuresinclude firewalls, anti-virus software, strong passwords, anti-spyware, etc.In eighth grade, students will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different physical and digital security systems. "),
("8.7","The student will identify impacts of hacking, ransomware, scams, fake vulnerability scans, and the ethical and legalconcerns involved. Exclusion: Students do not need to implement solutions.","Students will identify issues and impacts associated with electronic crimes such as hacking, phishing, identity and password theft,ransomware, scams, etc. Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Ransomware ismalicious software that encrypts a computer’s files unless its owner pays a ransom. It is the unauthorized access to or control overcomputer network security systems for some illicit purpose. This discussion will include the ethical and legal concerns that havearisen as more sensitive data is stored and transmitted electronically."),
("8.8","The student willa. explain the difference between a model and a simulation, andb. create computational models to conduct simulations.","Students will understand and explain the difference between a model and a simulation. Modeling means creating a physical replicaor equations of a situation or activity. A simulation is a virtual representation of a process that reflects how a real physical situationwould most likely happen. Simulations are created using models that were developed based on data. Programmers will createcomputational models to conduct simulations of familiar systems. Computational models can be created in pseudocode (written) orequations, in block languages (e.g., Scratch), or in text-based languages (e.g., Java, Python). There are also content specific tools formodeling such as MatLab for mathematics. Some examples of computation models might be modeling and simulating a bungeejump, investigating the temperature of melting ice, or investigating the forces and attractions in the states of matter."),
("8.9","The student will describe tradeoffs between allowing information to be public and keeping information private.","The Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution protects every American’s right to privacy. However, this amendment was writtenlong before the advent of the Internet, where personal information is easily accessed and, in some cases, exploited. Modern techcompanies, such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and others, mine users’ personal data and online habits to better advertise contentand products towards individuals. Students will explore what information they think should be publicly available. Students discussthe benefits and drawbacks to keeping information private when compared to public release."),
("8.10","The student will evaluate online and print sources for appropriateness and credibility.","While the Internet has made research much easier than in the past, this access has also allowed for non-vetted and factuallyinaccurate sources to be presented as equal in validity to more legitimately reviewed and researched outlets. Students will findsources that pertain to a particular topic and evaluate them for inclusion in their work. Students need to assess multiple aspects of asource to test its credibility. Criteria such as those listed in the Currency, Relevancy, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose (CRAAP)Model should be employed when evaluating online resources."),
("8.11","The student will discuss the social impacts and ethical considerations associated with the field of cybersecurity.","Cybersecurity is a growing industry in the world as more of our personal, financial, government, and military information istransmitted electronically and housed in data centers. Today’s cybersecurity concerns are varied and complex and include actionslike breaching of private information from governmental or business sources, the use of ransomware to withhold access to acomputing system, or global threats from the hacking of confidential data by hostile entities. Cybersecurity encompasses manyaspects of data protection in our society. Some examples are the protection of individual privacy, military information, credit cardand banking information, and social media profiles. In order to prevent loss of data, identity theft, or other cyberthreats, physical anddigital security measures must be practiced at all times.In eighth grade, students will weigh the advantages of cybersecurity in protecting individuals and systems against potentialdisadvantages of the over-restriction of content and delivery."),
("8.12","The student will explore careers related to the field of cybersecurity.","Due to the rise in cybersecurity threats and the increasing value of information and resources that are potentially vulnerable to thesethreats, the career field in cybersecurity has grown tremendously over the past decades. Examples of these kinds of jobs includesecurity software developer, information security analyst, ethical hacker (white hat), computer forensics analyst, and many others. Ineighth grade, Students will explore various aspects of these careers such as work done, pay rate, and education needed.Current information on education, pay, and employment projections can be found through the U.S.Bureau of Labor Statistics(https://www.bls.gov/emp/)."),
("8.13","The student will identify existing cybersecurity concerns associated with Internet use and Internet-based systems andpotential options to address these issues.","Cybersecurity risks can take many forms and have many consequences. The consequences of hacking can be serious and depend onwhat level of access the hackers have achieved. Examples of cybersecurity breaches include the theft of social security and creditinformation from Experian and the hack of Sony Pictures by the North Korean government. Computer viruses (scripts that may behidden in existing files or programs) and other malware (malicious software installed on a computer) generally have two goals: topropagate from system to system and to perform some action on each system they infect. Similarly, denial-of-service attacks cancripple an online business for long periods of time, which can greatly affect a business’s financials. In eighth grade, students willexplore possible risks to the data involved in their use of the Internet. They will also explore the risks and cyber threats for whichcompanies plan and prepare.");
